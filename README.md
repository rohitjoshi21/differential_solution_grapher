# Differential Grapher

Differential Equation grapher is a program written in python which solves a first order differential equation using 3 different methods and plots each solution on a same graph.
It compares following three methods:
1. Euler's Method
2. RK2 Method
3. RK4 Method

To be precise, it solves differential equation of the form:
